						<h3>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h3>
						<p>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple yet entertaining hand game often used to make decisions or resolve disputes. Two players simultaneously choose one of three shapes with their hands: rock (a fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The winner is determined by the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.</p>
